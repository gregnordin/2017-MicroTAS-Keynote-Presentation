This repository contains the slide deck for our keynote address, *Miniaturizing 3D Printed Microfluidics*, at the [MicroTAS 2017](https://www.microtas2017.org) conference in Savannah, Georgia on October 23, 2017 in *Session 1A2 - 3D Printing - Fundamentals*. The presentation focuses on our efforts to develop 3D printing for fabrication of microfluidic devices with features in the truly *micro*fluidic size regime. To this end, we report the development of a custom 3D printer and associated photopolymerizable resin that enables us to 3D print flow channels with cross section as small as 18 &mu;m &times; 20 &mu;m and pneumatically actuated valves only 300 &mu;m in diameter. With these building blocks, we demonstrate pumps and more complex integrated active components, each of which is tightly laid out in 3D (as opposed to 2D) in fabricated devices.
